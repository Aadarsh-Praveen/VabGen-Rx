# 🧪 Vab Gen Rx

### Multi-Agent Clinical Decision Support & Medication Safety Platform

🚀 Microsoft AI Dev Days Hackathon 2026 Submission
Hosted by Microsoft

---

## 🌍 Overview

Vab Gen Rx is an enterprise-grade, multi-agent clinical decision support platform designed to improve medication safety, dosing accuracy, patient counseling, and pharmacy access for Community Health Centers.

The platform acts as an intelligent support layer integrated into prescribing workflows to help clinicians identify drug interactions, optimize dosing, reduce adverse drug events, and improve medication accessibility — while maintaining full clinician control over medical decisions.

Medication-related harm is a major public health challenge, particularly among elderly and chronically ill patients receiving multiple medications across fragmented care systems. Vab Gen Rx addresses this system-level problem by combining AI agents, evidence-based rules, and workflow automation into a unified solution.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Community Health Centers face critical challenges:

* Fragmented medication histories across providers
* Polypharmacy and drug interaction risks
* Incorrect dosing for renal or hepatic impairment
* Medication non-adherence due to access barriers
* Pharmacy deserts and medication availability issues
* Provider workflow burden and alert fatigue

These issues contribute to preventable adverse drug events, emergency visits, and hospitalizations.

---

## 💡 Solution

Vab Gen Rx provides an AI-powered platform that supports clinicians and patients through:

* Medication reconciliation and interaction detection
* AI-assisted dosing optimization
* Adverse drug event risk prediction
* Automated patient counseling generation
* Pharmacy availability and therapeutic alternatives
* Explainable and transparent clinical recommendations

The system enhances — but does not replace — clinician judgment.

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture

Vab Gen Rx leverages multiple specialized AI agents:

* **Medication Reconciliation Agent** — Detects duplicate therapies and conflicts
* **Drug Interaction Agent** — Identifies contraindications and interaction risks
* **Dosing Optimization Agent** — Provides patient-specific dose recommendations
* **Risk Prediction Agent** — Identifies high-risk patients for adverse events
* **Counseling Agent** — Generates patient-friendly medication instructions
* **Pharmacy Access Agent** — Identifies nearby pharmacies and alternatives

These agents collaborate using multi-agent orchestration patterns.
